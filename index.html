  <h3>Goal</h3>
<p>1) Transform information on public lands into useful, user-friendly formats that will inspire visitors to explore our natural resources, boosting tourism, outdoor recreation, jobs, and economic activity in local communities.</p>

<p>2) Improve equitable access to the outdoors for socially and economically disadvantaged members of society. Introduce the outdoors to diverse, younger, urban, or non-traditional populations.</p>  

<p>3) Help federal land managers support recreation across parks, forests, and waters with a cost-effective and citizen-centric approach.</p> 

<p>Research suggests that access to nature is an important component of physical, social, and mental wellbeing (Shanahan et al, 2014).  By making open spaces, parks, and public lands easier to reach and explore, more citizens can be part of the benefits that these lands afford us.</p>


  <h3>Data Resources</h3>
<p>The Recreation Information Database (RIDB)</p>
<p>National Park Service Data Store</p>
<p>US Fish and Wildlife Service GIS Data</p>
<p>Bureau of Land Management GeoCommunicator</p>

  <h3>Project Ideas</h3>
- Trip Planning Tools - provide visitors with user-focused, intuitive, and interactive trip planning or visitor services information 
- Platforms for crowd-sourced trail data, promoting less-signed paths and allowing land managers to better respond to requests and safety concerns
- Activity-specific trail data (e.g. mountain biking), improving public health through accessible ways to exercise
- Multilingual options/digital passport - provide information to foreign visitors about America’s iconic vistas or near highly-visited cities
- Trip experience guides and resources for deaf and blind visitors
-In-park informational beacons - help visitors find local favorites, hidden gems, or provide deeper context to our country’s diverse history and natural resources
-Educational and competitive games for kids, combatting the growing disconnect between young people and the outdoors
- Transit Hub - connect recreation opportunities with public transit options
- Event Finder - connect visitors with local activities
